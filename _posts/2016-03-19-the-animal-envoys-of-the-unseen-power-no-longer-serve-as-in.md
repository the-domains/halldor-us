  The animal envoys of the Unseen Power no longer serve, as

  inprimeval times, to teach and to guide

  mankind.Bears, lions, elephants,

  ibexes, and gazelles are in cages in our zoos.Man is no longer the newcomer in
  a world of unexplored plains and

  forests, and our immediate neighbors are not wild beasts but other human
  beings,

  contending for goods and space on a planet that is whirling without end around

  the fireball of a star.Neither in body

  nor in mind do we inhabit the world of those hunting races of the Paleolithic

  millennia, to whose lives and life ways we nevertheless owe the very forms of

  our bodies and structures of our minds.Memories of their animal envoys still
  must sleep, somehow, within us;

  for they wake a little and stir when we venture into wilderness.They wake in
  terror to thunder,And again they wake, with a sense of

  recognition, when we enter any one of those great painted caves.Whatever the
  inward darkness may have been to

  which the shamans of those caves descended in their trances, the same must lie

  within ourselves, nightly visited in sleep.-- Joseph Campbell

The animal envoys of the Unseen Power no longer serve, as
in primeval times, to teach and to guide
mankind.  Bears, lions, elephants,
ibexes, and gazelles are in cages in our zoos.  Man is no longer the newcomer in a world of unexplored plains and
forests, and our immediate neighbors are not wild beasts but other human beings,
contending for goods and space on a planet that is whirling without end around
the fireball of a star.

Neither in body
nor in mind do we inhabit the world of those hunting races of the Paleolithic
millennia, to whose lives and life ways we nevertheless owe the very forms of
our bodies and structures of our minds.  Memories of their animal envoys still must sleep, somehow, within us;
for they wake a little and stir when we venture into wilderness.  They wake in terror to thunder, And again they wake, with a sense of
recognition, when we enter any one of those great painted caves.

Whatever the inward darkness may have been to
which the shamans of those caves descended in their trances, the same must lie
within ourselves, nightly visited in sleep. -- Joseph Campbell
